# Planned Features & Improvements

## Critical

The entire toolchain needs to be updated. We're outdated, we are _severely_
outdated.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add JSDoc to remaining functions.
- [ ] NixOS module
- [ ] Publish packages
- [ ] Documentation for examples
  - [ ] Support examples for the init command

## Future Plans

I want to consider a WASM based extension system for small utilities. We might
see some performance benefits, especially from replacing the entrypoint.
